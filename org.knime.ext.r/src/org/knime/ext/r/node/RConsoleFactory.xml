	<shortDescription>
		Allows execution of R commands on an R Server. The result of these R 
		commands is returned in the output table of this node. The final result 
		table will have only one column, named "R". Currently integers, 
		doubles, and strings are supported held in lists, one-dimensional 
		arrays, and single elements. (Matrix support will follow in a future 
		version of KNIME.)

		<intro>
			Allows execution of R commands on an R Server. The entire data 
			(compatible to int, double, and String types) is
			transfered to the R Server which then executes a series of R commands
			entered in the dialog. Each column can be accessed by the name provided
			in the input data table. The output has to be assigned to a variable
			named R. Missing values are supported, that is, missing
	 	    values in numeric columns are transfered as <tt>NaN</tt> (Not a 
		    Number) to the R server while missing values in all other types of 
		    columns are sent as <tt>NA</tt>.
			<p><b>R installation:</b><br/>
		    In order to get the R nodes running, you have to install the R-project 
		    first, see <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a>.
    	     Also the R Server which responds to R commands has to be installed 
    	     and running, see <a href="http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve">
    	     http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve</a><br/>. 
    	    Also make sure that you have the lastest available or compatible 
    	    R-project version at hand. For Windows you may download an R Server 
    	    for your R-project version. All other operating systems require the 
    	    most recent clients (R-project installation).
    	    We offer downloads of current 
    	    versions of R and R-Serve that are compatible with KNIME on our 
    	    website. Please note that in the current version the R Server needs
    	    to be restarted from time to time. If an R node hangs, interrupt 
    	    the R Server and restart it. Warnings and errors are printed in the
    	    R Server window.
