	<shortDescription>
		Allows execution of R commands on an R server. The result of these R 
		commands is returned in the output table of this node. The final result 
		tables' columns are named R1, R2, and so on.

		<intro>
			<p>
			Allows execution of R commands on an R server. The entire data 
			(compatible to int, double, and String types) is
			transfered to the R server which then executes a series of R commands
			entered in the dialog. Each column can be accessed by the name provided
			in the input data table. The output has to be assigned to a variable
			named R. Missing values are supported, that is, missing
	 	    values in numeric columns are transfered as <tt>NaN</tt> (Not a 
		    Number) to the R server while missing values in all other types of 
		    columns are sent as <tt>NA</tt>.</p>
			<p><b>R installation:</b><br/>
		    In order to get the R nodes running, you have to install the R-project 
		    first, see <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a>.
    	     Also the R server which responds to R commands has to be installed 
    	     and running, see <a href="http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/">
    	     http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/</a>.<br/> 
    	    Also make sure that you have the latest available or compatible 
    	    R-project version at hand. For Windows you may download an R server 
    	    for your R-project version. All other operating systems require the 
    	    most recent clients (R-project installation).
    	    We offer downloads of current 
    	    versions of R and Rserve that are compatible with KNIME on our 
    	    website. Please note that in the current version the R server needs
    	    to be restarted from time to time. If an R node hangs, interrupt 
    	    the R server and restart it. Warnings and errors are printed in the
    	    R server window.
    	    </p>
