		   <p>
			Allows execution of R commands on an R Server within this node's view.
		   The results are also displayed in the view. The entire data 
		   (compatible to int, double, and String types) is
		   transfered to the R Server which then reacts to R commands entered 
		   in the view. Each column can be accessed by the name provided in
		   the input data table. Missing values are supported, that is, missing
		   values in numeric columns are transfered as <tt>NaN</tt> (Not a 
		   Number) to the R server while missing values in all other types of 
		   columns are sent as <tt>NA</tt>.
		   </p>
			<p><b>R installation:</b><br/>
		    In order to get the R nodes running, you have to install the R-project 
		    first, see <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a>.
    	     Also the R Server which responds to R commands has to be installed 
    	     and running, see <a href="http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve">
    	     http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve</a>.<br/>
    	    Also make sure that you have the latest available or compatible 
    	    R-project version at hand. For Windows you may download an R Server 
    	    for your R-project version. All other operating systems require the 
    	    most recent clients (R-project installation).
    	    We offer downloads of current 
    	    versions of R and R-Serve that are compatible with KNIME on our 
    	    website. Please note that in the current version the R Server needs
    	    to be restarted from time to time. If an R node hangs, interrupt 
    	    the R Server and restart it. Warnings and errors are printed in the
    	    R Server window.
