		<intro>
		Converts a KNIME data table into an R object which can be manipulated during execution.
		The input data is written to a CSV file and imported into an R workspace which is then available at the node
		out-port. The data must be returned as variable called R.

		More details about R:<br />

		  <option name ="R Snippet">
            The R commands to run.
          </option>
          <option name="Column List">
            The list contains the column that are available in the input table.
            Double click any of the column names to insert the respective field
            in the expression editor. It will replace your current selection or
            simply insert at the current caret position.
          </option>
          <option name="Flow Variable List">
            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
            selection, if any).

        <tab name="R Binary">
		  <option name ="R binary path">
			Path to the local R executable. Note that it is possible to specify
			the path to the local R executable also in the R section of the

		  </option>
		  <option name ="Arguments for R binary">
            Add additional arguments run together with the R binary. The 
            '--vanilla' mode ensures a clean workspace and may cause problems 
            when removed.
          </option>
		  <option name="Override default">
			If checked, the specified file is used as R binary. If not checked, 
			the file specified in the KNIME's R preferences is used.
