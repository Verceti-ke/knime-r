	<name>R Predictor</name>
	<shortDescription>
	    Allows to import a R model and predict given data by the use of the 
	    model.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Allows execution of R command to use the R model at the model in port
		to predict the class of the data at in data in port. 
		The predicted data is returned in the data output port.
		All input data is written to a CSV file and imported into R, 
		saved in the variable named RDATA. The model is imported into R
		too saved in the variable named RMODEL.
