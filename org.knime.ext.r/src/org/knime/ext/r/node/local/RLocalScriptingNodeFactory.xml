		<intro>
		Allows execution of R commands in a local R installation. The result of 
		these R commands is returned in the output table of this node. All
		input data is written to a CSV file, imported into R 
		(saved in the variable named R) and processed together with the 
		R commands. The result which has to be saved into variable R as 
		well is written to a CSV file again and then imported into KNIME.
