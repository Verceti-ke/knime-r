We need a package manager on Mac OS X to install additional system libraries.
Installing the 'Homebrew' (https://brew.sh) package manager for that is the
default settings. To disable the installation of 'Homebrew' set 
MAC_INSTALL_HOMEBREW=false at the beginning of the script.

Uninstalling 'Homebrew' (https://brew.sh) package manager at the end of the 
script is not the default settings, i.e. by default 'Homebrew' is not 
uninstalled. If you wish to uninstall 'Homebrew' set 
MAC_UNINSTALL_HOMEBREW=true at the beginning of the script.
