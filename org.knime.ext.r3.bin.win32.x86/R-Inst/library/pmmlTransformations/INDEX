DiscretizeXform         Discretizes a continuous variable to a discrete
                        one as indicated by interval mappings. This is
                        in accordance to the PMML element: *Discretize*
FunctionXform           Add a function transformation to a WrapData
                        object.
Initialize              Initialize internal variables in a WrapData
                        object
MapXform                Implements a map between discrete values in
                        accordance to the PMML element: *MapValues*
MinMaxXform             Normalizes continuous values in accordance to
                        the PMML element: *NormContinuous*
NormDiscreteXform       Normalize discrete values in accordance to the
                        PMML element: *NormDiscrete*
RenameVar               Renames a variable in the WrapData transform
                        object
WrapData                Wrap raw data in an R object
ZScoreXform             Performs a z-score normalization on continuous
                        values in accordance to the PMML element:
                        *NormContinuous*
