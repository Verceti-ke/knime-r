_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generate the PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language)
     representation of an 'lm' object. The PMML can then be imported
     into other systems that accept PMML.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'lm':
     pmml(model, model.name="Regression_model", app.name="Rattle/PMML",
          description="Regression Model", copyright=NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   model: an lm object.

model.name: a name to give to the model in the PMML.

app.name: the name of the application that generated the PMML.

description: a descriptive text for the header of the PMML.

copyright: the copyright notice for the model.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
     application, such as Zementis' ADAPA.

     Currently, the resultant PMML document will not encode interaction
     terms.

     Only numeric regression is supported currently. Generalised linear
     models (logistic regression) are not yet supported.
