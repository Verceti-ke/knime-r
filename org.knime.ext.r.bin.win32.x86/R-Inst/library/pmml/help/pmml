     'pmml' is a generic function implementing S3 methods used to
     produce the PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) representation
     of an R model.  The PMML can then be imported into other systems
     that accept PMML.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     pmml(model, model.name="Rattle_Model", app.name="Rattle/PMML",
          description=NULL, copyright=NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   model: an object to be converted to PMML.

model.name: a name to give to the model in the PMML.

app.name: the name of the application that generated the PMML.

description: a descriptive text for the header of the PMML.

copyright: the copyright notice for the model.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
     application, such as Teradata Warehouse Miner and DB2. Generally,
     these applications convert the PMML into SQL for execution across
     a database.
