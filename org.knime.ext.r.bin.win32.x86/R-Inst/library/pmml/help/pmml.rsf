_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generate the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)
     representation of a 'randomSurvivalForest' forest object.  In
     particular, this function gives the user the ability to save the
     geometry of a forest as a PMML XML document.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'rsf':
     pmml(model, model.name="rsfForest_Model", app.name="Rattle/PMML",
          description="Random Survival Forest Tree Model", copyright, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   model: the 'forest' object contained in an object of class
          'randomSurvivalForest', as that contained in the object
          returned by the function 'rsf' with the parameter
          “forest=TRUE”.

model.name: a name to give to the model in the PMML.

app.name: the name of the application that generated the PMML.

description: a descriptive text for the header of the PMML.

copyright: the copyright notice for the model.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The Predictive Model Markup Language is an XML based language
     which provides a way for applications to define statistical and
     data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant
     applications.  More information about PMML and the Data Mining
     Group can be found at http://www.dmg.org.  

     Use of PMML and 'pmml.rsf' requires the 'XML' package.  Be aware
     that XML is a very verbose data format.  Reasonably sized trees
     and data sets can lead to extremely large text files.  XML, while
     achieving interoperability, is not an efficient data storage
     mechanism in this case.

     This function is used to export the geometry of the forest to
     other PMML compliant applications, including graphics packages
     that are capable of printing binary trees.  In addition, the user
     may wish to save the geometry of the forest for later retrieval
     and prediction on new data sets using 'pmml.rsf' together with
     'pmml_to_rsf'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An object of class 'XMLNode' as that defined by the 'XML' package.
      This represents the top level, or root node, of the XML document
     and is of type PMML. It can be written to file with 'saveXML'.

_N_o_t_e:

     One cautionary note is in order.  The PMML representation of the
     'randomSurvivalForest' forest object is incomplete, in that the
     object needs to be massaged in order for prediction to be
     possible. This will be clear in the examples.  This deficiency
     will be addressed in future releases of this package.  However, it
     was felt that the current functionality was important enough and
     mature enough to warrant release in this version of the product.
