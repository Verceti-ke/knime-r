     Generate the PMML representation for a nnet object (Neural
     Network).  The nnet object is converted into a PMML
     representation. The PMML  can then be imported into other systems
     that accept PMML.  With this code, a PMML representation can be
     obtained for Neural Networks implementing classification
     (multi-class and binary) as well as regression.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'nnet':
     pmml(model, model.name="NeuralNet_model", app.name="Rattle/PMML",
          description="Neural Network PMML Model", copyright=NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   model: a nnet object.

model.name: a name to give to the model in the PMML.

app.name: the name of the application that generated the PMML.

description: a descriptive text for the header of the PMML.

copyright: the copyright notice for the model.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
     application that recognizes PMML 3.2. An example is ADAPA.  ADAPA
     (Adaptive Decision and Predictive Analytics) is a lightweight 
     decision engine that offers at its core batch and real-time
     scoring  of predictive models as well as fast execution of
     business rules.  ADAPA supports an extensive collection of PMML
     elements, including the  following predictive techniques: 1)
     Neural Networks (Backprogagation  and Neural Gas); 2) Support
     Vector Machines; 3) Linear and Logistic  Regression as well as all
     general regression PMML models: a) Multinomial  Logistic; b)
     General Linear; 3) Ordinal Multinomial; 4) Simple Regression;  and
     5) Generalized Linear Model. ADAPA  provides a reliable and fast 
     way to manage, deploy, and execute a multitude of models and
     decision  strategies.
