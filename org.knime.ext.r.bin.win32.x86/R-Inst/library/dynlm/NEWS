Changes in Version 0.3-1

  o Fixed bug in computation of R-squared values and Wald statistic
    for two-stage least squares.


Changes in Version 0.3-0

  o Added new formula functions trend() and harmon() that
    allow convenient specification of linear or cyclical
    patterns.


Changes in Version 0.2-3

  o fixed bug when lagged variables are used in instrumental

Changes in Version 0.2-1

  o enhanced documentation ?dynlm


Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o added support for instrumental variables regression
    (two-stage least squares) via formulas like
      dynlm(y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3, data = mydata)
    where z1, z2, z3 are the instruments.
  
  o enabled specification of multiple lags via formulas like
      dynlm(y ~ L(x, 0:4), data = mydata)
    where y is regressed on x and lags 1 through 4 of x.

  o fixed bug in time properties when there were leading
    NAs in the data
