<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Implementation of Trellis Graphics in R
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Trellis Graphics is a framework for data visualization developed at
the Bell Labs by Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland et al, extending ideas
presented in Bill Cleveland's 1993 book <EM>Visualizing Data</EM>.
</p>
<p>
Lattice is best thought of as an implementation of Trellis Graphics
for R.  It is built upon the Grid graphics engine and requires the
<code>grid</code> add-on package.  It is not (readily) compatible with
traditional R graphics tools.  The public interface is based on the
implementation in S-PLUS, but features several extensions, in addition
to incompatibilities introduced through the use of <code>grid</code>.  To
the extent possible, care has been taken to ensure that existing
Trellis code written for S-PLUS works unchanged (or with minimal
change) in Lattice. If you are having problems porting S-PLUS code,
read the entry for <code>panel</code> in the documentation for
<code><a href="xyplot.html">xyplot</a></code>. Most high level Trellis functions in S-PLUS are
implemented, with the exception of <code>piechart</code>.
</p>
<p>
Type <code>help(package = lattice)</code> to see a list of (public)
Lattice graphics functions for which further documentation is
available.  The &lsquo;See Also&rsquo; section below has list of specific
areas of possible interest and pointers to the help pages with
respective details.  Apart from the documentation accompanying this
package, several documents outlining the use of Trellis graphics are
available from Bell Lab's website; these might provide a holistic
introduction to the Trellis paradigm.  A book on lattice is also
available as part of Springer's &lsquo;Use R&rsquo; series.
</p>
<p>
The example section below shows how to bring up a brief history of
changes to the lattice package, which provides a summary of new
features.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
High level Lattice functions (like <code><a href="xyplot.html">xyplot</a></code>) are different
from conventional R graphics functions because they don't actually
draw anything. Instead, they return an object of class
<code>"trellis"</code> which has to be then
<code><a href="print.trellis.html">print</a></code>ed or
<code><a href="print.trellis.html">plot</a></code>ted to create the actual
plot.  This is normally done automatically, but not when the high
level functions are called inside another function (most often
<code>source</code>) or other contexts where automatic printing is
suppressed (e.g. <code><a href="../../base/html/Control.html">for</a></code> or <code><a href="../../base/html/Control.html">while</a></code> loops).  In
such situations, an explicit call to <code>print</code> or <code>plot</code> is
required.
</p>
<p>
Lattice plots are highly customizable via user-modifiable settings.
However, these are completely unrelated to base graphics settings; in
particular, changing <code>par()</code> settings usually have no effect on
lattice plots.

The Lattice user interface primarily consists of several &lsquo;high
level&rsquo; generic functions (listed below), each designed to create a
particular type of statistical display by default.  While each
function does different things, they share several common features,
reflected in several common arguments that affect the resulting
displays in similar ways.  These arguments are extensively (sometimes
only) documented in the help page for <code><a href="xyplot.html">xyplot</a></code>.  This
includes a discussion of <EM>conditioning</EM> and control of the
Trellis layout.
</p>
<p>
Lattice employs an extensive system of user-controllable parameters to
determine the look and feel of the displays it produces.  To learn how
to use and customise the Graphical parameters used by the Lattice
functions, see <code><a href="trellis.par.get.html">trellis.par.set</a></code>.  For other settings, see
<code><a href="lattice.options.html">lattice.options</a></code>.  The default graphical settings are
different for different graphical devices.  To learn how to initialise
new devices with the desired settings or change the settings of the
current device, see <code><a href="trellis.device.html">trellis.device</a></code>.
</p>
<p>
To learn about sophisticated (non-default) printing capabilities, see
<code><a href="print.trellis.html">print.trellis</a></code>.  See <code><a href="update.trellis.html">update.trellis</a></code> to
learn about manipulating a <code>"trellis"</code> object.  Tools to augment
lattice plots after they are drawn (including
<code><a href="../../graphics/html/locator.html">locator</a></code>-like functionality) is described in the
<code><a href="interaction.html">trellis.focus</a></code> help page.
</p>
<p>
The following is a list of &lsquo;high level&rsquo; functions in the
Lattice package with a brief description of what they do.  In all
cases, the actual display is produced by the so-called <code>panel</code>
function, which has a suitable default, but can be substituted by an
user defined function to create custom displays.  The user will most
often be interested in the default panel functions, which have a
separate help page, linked to from the help pages of the corresponding
high level function.  Although documented separately, arguments to
these panel functions can be supplied directly to the high level
functions, which will forward the arguments as appropriate.

Additionally, there are several panel functions that do little by
themselves, but can be useful components of custom panel functions.
These are documented in <code><a href="panel.functions.html">panel.functions</a></code>.  Lattice also
has a collection of convenience functions that correspond to the base
graphics primitives <code><a href="../../graphics/html/lines.html">lines</a></code>, <code><a href="../../graphics/html/points.html">points</a></code>,
etc.  They are implemented using Grid graphics, but try to be as close
to the base versions as possible in terms of their argument
list.  These functions have imaginative names like
<code><a href="llines.html">llines</a></code> or <code><a href="llines.html">panel.lines</a></code> and are often useful
when writing (or porting from S-PLUS code) nontrivial panel functions.
