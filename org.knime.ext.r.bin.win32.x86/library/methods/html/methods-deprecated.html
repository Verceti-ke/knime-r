<h2>Deprecated Functions in Methods package</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
These functions are provided for compatibility with older versions of
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> only, and may be defunct as soon as the next release.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
getAllMethods(f, fdef, where)
mlistMetaName (name, package)
removeMethodsObject(f, where)
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The original help page for these functions is often
available at <code>help("oldName-deprecated")</code> (note the quotes).
Functions in packages other than the methods package are listed in
<code>help("pkg-deprecated")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Summary of Functions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>getAllMethods</code>:</dt><dd>This function replicates the behavior of
<code><a href="findMethods.html">getMethods</a></code>, which should be called instead to obtain
approximately the old behavior of <code>getAllMethods</code>.  However, a
better substitution is to use <code><a href="findMethods.html">findMethods</a></code>, which
returns a simpler structure.
</p>
<p>
(The following is the original description, which has not been
accurate since approximately version 2.5.0 of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.) 
</p>
<p>
A generic function (with methods) representing the merge of all
the methods defined for this generic starting from environment
<code>where</code>, including all parent environments.  By default,
uses the global environment (and therefore all packages on the
search list).  This function exists largely
to re-compute the full set of methods when a change to the
available methods occurs.  Since all such recomputations are
supposed to be automatic, direct calls to <code>getAllMethods</code>
should not be needed.
</p>
<p>
If the generic <code>f</code> has a group generic, methods for this
group generic (and further generations of group generics, if any)
are also merged.
</p>
<p>
The merging rule is as follows: each generic is merged across
packages, and the group generics are then merged, finally adding
the directly defined methods of <code>f</code>.
</p>
<p>
The effect of the merging rule is that any method directly defined
for <code>f</code> on any included package overrides a method for the
same signature defined for the group generic; similarly for the
group generic and its group, if any, etc.
</p>
<p>
For <code>f</code> or for a specific group generic, methods override in
the order of the packages being searched.  A method for a
particular signature on a particular package overrides any methods
for the same signature on packages later on in the list of
packages being searched.
</p>
<p>
The slot <code>"allMethods"</code> of the merged methods list is set to
a copy of the methods slot; this is the slot where inherited
methods are stored.)
</dd>


<dt><code>mlistMetaName</code>:</dt><dd>Utility to  return the mangled
name for the object that stored the <code>MethodsList</code>
representation of the methods for a particular generic function,
typically in the environment of a package.
</p>
<p>
These objects are no longer used, and will likely not be generated
starting in version 2.8.0 of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
</dd>


<dt><code>removeMethodsObject</code>:</dt><dd>remove the metadata object containing methods for <code>f</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
