<h2>Read and Write Data in DCF Format</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Reads or writes an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object from/to a file in Debian Control File
format.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
read.dcf(file, fields = NULL, all = FALSE)

write.dcf(x, file = "", append = FALSE,
          indent = 0.1 * getOption("width"),
          width = 0.9 * getOption("width"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
either a character string naming a file or a connection.
<code>""</code> indicates output to the console.  For <code>read.dcf</code> this
can name a <code>gzip</code>-compressed file.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fields</code></td>
<td>
Fields to read from the DCF file.  Default is to read all
fields.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>all</code></td>
<td>
a logical indicating whether in case of multiple
occurrences of a field in a record, all these should be gathered.
If <code>all</code> is false (default), only the last such occurrence is
used.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
the object to be written, typically a data frame.  If not, it
is attempted to coerce <code>x</code> to a data frame.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>append</code></td>
<td>
logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, the output is appended to the
file.  If <code>FALSE</code>, any existing file of the name is destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>indent</code></td>
<td>
a positive integer specifying the indentation for
continuation lines in output entries.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
a positive integer giving the target column for wrapping
lines in the output.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
DCF is a simple format for storing databases in plain text files that
can easily be directly read and written by humans.  DCF is used in
various places to store <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> system information, like descriptions and
contents of packages.
</p>
<p>
The DCF rules as implemented in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> are:
<ol>
<li>A database consists of one or more records, each with one or
more named fields.  Not every record must contain each field.
Fields may appear more than once in a record.
<li>Regular lines start with a non-whitespace character.
<li>Regular lines are of form <code>tag:value</code>, i.e., have a name
tag and a value for the field, separated by <code>:</code> (only the first
<code>:</code> counts).  The value can be empty (=whitespace only).
<li>Lines starting with whitespace are continuation lines (to the
preceding field) if at least one character in the line is
non-whitespace.  Continuation lines where the only non-whitespace
character is a <span class="samp">.</span> are taken as blank lines (allowing for
multi-paragraph field values).
<li>Records are separated by one or more empty (=whitespace only)
lines.
</ol>

<p>
By default, <code>read.dcf</code> returns a character matrix with one row
per record and one column per field.  Leading and trailing whitespace
of field values is ignored.  If a tag name is specified, but the
corresponding value is empty, then an empty string is returned.  If
the tag name of a field is never used in a record, then <code>NA</code> is
returned.  If fields are repeated within a record, the last one
encountered is returned.  Malformed lines are ignored (with a
warning).  If <code>all</code> is true, a data frame is returned, again with
one row per record and one column per field, and columns lists of
character vectors for fields with multiple occurrences, and character
vectors otherwise.
</p>
<p>
<code>write.dcf</code> does not write <code>NA</code> fields.
